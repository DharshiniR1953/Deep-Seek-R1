# Deep-Seek-R1-with-GenAI
The provided code sets up an AI-powered assistant called DeepSeek using Streamlit for the user interface and LangChain for managing AI prompts. It integrates with the Ollama model to handle user queries related to coding and debugging. The application allows users to select between different versions of the DeepSeek model (e.g., deepseek-r1:1.5b, deepseek-r1:3b) from the sidebar and interacts with them in a chat-like format. It generates responses based on user input by dynamically building a prompt chain that includes the system message and any prior conversation history, ensuring contextually aware interactions.

**DeepSeek Models**

**1. deepseek-r1:1.5b:**

A smaller, efficient model ideal for basic tasks.
Provides fast solutions for general problem-solving, including code generation, debugging, and basic design advice.
Suitable for developers looking for quick answers or lightweight assistance.

**2. deepseek-r1:3b:**

A more powerful model designed to handle more complex queries and tasks.
Offers deeper insights into coding problems, better debugging capabilities, and more thorough design assistance.
Ideal for developers working on larger projects or requiring more detailed analysis and suggestions.

**3. deepseek-v2:**

Enhanced with better language understanding and reasoning capabilities.
Provides advanced debugging, multi-turn conversation management, and AI-assisted code reviews.
Offers more accurate solution designs, including architecture suggestions and optimization recommendations.
Ideal for teams working on medium-to-large scale projects that require efficient problem-solving and structured designs.

**4. deepseek-v3:**

The most powerful version with advanced capabilities for a variety of tasks.
Supports multilingual coding environments and provides AI-guided code refactoring and optimization.
Features code quality analysis, security vulnerability detection, and algorithmic problem-solving.
Ideal for handling large-scale, complex systems and offering in-depth insights into architecture and code quality.



**Architectural Breakthroughs:**

**Mixture-of-Experts (MoE):**  Activates only subsets of the model per task, reducing computational load.

**Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA):** Optimizes attention mechanisms for resource-constrained environments.

These techniques enable high performance without relying on cutting-edge hardware.
